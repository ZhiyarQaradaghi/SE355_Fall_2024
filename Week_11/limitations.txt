If I have 2 idempotent functions 
f(x) = f(f(x))
g(x) = g(g(x))

if f(x) adds and g(x) subtracts 
g(f(x)) != f(g(f(x))) --> this is created by causality 

The composition of both is not necessarily idempotent 

User 1 asks to execute f(x), then fails and retries and gets ack. <-- idempotent no side effect in retry
